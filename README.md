## Description

This application is a calendar layout that allows the user to create and save events for 9am to 5pm time blocks. The current day and time is displayed at the top of the page using the moment.js library. Each time block consists of an hour, an input text area for event details, and a save button. The input text area is assigned a class of "past", "present", or "future" based on the current hour, with past hours being grayed out and future hours being highlighted. The user can save their event details by clicking the save button, which stores the input text in the local storage using the hour as the key.
